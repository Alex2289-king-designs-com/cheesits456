## About Me

<p align="justify">I am a NodeJS developer with 11 years of coding experience.</p>

<p align="justify">I started in 2009 with HTML and CSS, making simple static web pages and expanding my knowledge over time. Around 2010/2011, I started to learn how to use JavaScript to create dynamic web apps. During this time I also learned a version of BASIC so I could program games for my 3DS, using a DSi app called Petit Computer. In 2015 I found NodeJS, and started using it to create some basic bots for various chat platforms.</p>

<p align="justify">My goal with coding is to help others. I enjoy being able to create something that other people can use to make their lives easier. I take criticism well, and use suggestions to improve the product. The wants and/or needs of the userbase are always my priority, because without a supportive userbase, the product has no real purpose.</p>

<p align="justify">Over the last few years, my knowledge and experience with NodeJS have expanded, as has my main project, which currently has nearly one million users. I am fluent in using JavaScript and JSON within the Node environment, as well as all the features of ES6. I also have a solid understanding of HTML and CSS, and am able to work with web apps or other browser-based environments.</p>
